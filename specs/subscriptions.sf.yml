        By default, customers receive abandoned cart emails as soon as they provide their email address in the checkout flow. They can opt out using this endpoint.

        However, if **Store Settings > Miscellaneous > Require Consent** is enabled, Abandoned Cart Emails are not sent by default, and the customer should opt-in.
